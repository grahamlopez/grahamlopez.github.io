VPS hosting
***************

Sometimes it is nice to get a remote system of some kind, or a lightweight
throw-away instance. This is where virtual private servers come in. Note that
you don't have to run containers on them, but this is a common thing to do.

AWS is the most obvious choice, and while it is super powerful, I find it super
complicated as well. There are other, smaller VPS hosting companies that are
sometimes cheaper than AWS, still have developer-friendly features, and are
overall a bit simpler to use at the possible expense of automation features
targeted at enterprise/production applications.

I actually only use these services intermittently, so this is a place to keep
some reminders to myself about how to use them, etc.

misc for vps hosting
=====================

to point DNS at a VPS:

* login to domain registrar and change the nameservers for the domain

    * ns1,ns2.vultr.com
    * ns1,ns2,ns3.digitalocean.com

* go to the DNS dashboard of the VPS provider and add the entries

    * just set the "default domain" to some IP of a VPS (this will make the A
      record for the domain)
    * then add additional A records to make the hostname point to the right
      place
