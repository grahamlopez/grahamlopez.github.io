| Ph.D. Research
| *Calculating Magnetic Properties in Condensed Matter Systems*

This work expanded and utilized ab initio computational techniques for
calculating magnetic properties such as the orbital magnetization and nuclear
magnetic resonance chemical shielding of infinitely periodic systems. It
included development of the necessary extensions to the current theoretical
methods, the code that implements these methods, and calculations on materials
of interest using the techniques.

| M.S. Research
| *A Computational Method to Explore the Time Evolution of Protein Cavities*

This thesis presented a tool for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations by
tracking and visualizing protein cavity evolution through time. This was done in
order to examine the impact of negative space on protein allostery.
