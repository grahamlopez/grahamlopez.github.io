Summary:

1. Snapshots, not deltas
2. History is only for humans
3. Branching is free
4. Ignore the index
5. There are no server repositories


## 1) "Snapshots, not deltas"
At each commit, git stores a snapshot of the entire repository state. It is more
like cd'ing out of the source code directory, tar'ing it up, renaming the
tarball to source.tar.backup1, and cd'ing back into the source directory.
Whereas with other VCS implementations like SVN, at each commit, they store the
changes made from the previous state. To reconstruct the current state of the
repository, git needs the information from that commit, whereas SVN needs the
information for that commit and the entire history leading to it.

Even in the case of git operations that use diffs
(e.g. `git cherry-pick`, `git rebase`, etc.), git finds the relevant snapshots
and calculates the deltas on the fly.

## 2) "History is only for humans"
To git, the contents of the repository are more or less just a pile of data.
There is no explicit dependency between commits since each one is a stand-alone
snapshot of the repository (see point #1 above). The history is just provided as
a way for the user to navigate the commits that git has collected over time.

## 3) "Branching is free"
This is technically not true, but branching is so cheap that it should be
thought of as free. So branch for everything.

## 4) "Ignore the index"
It IS useful, but only once you know why you need it (hint: not all the time!)
For example, some instances where one might want to use the index cleverly:

- staging helps you split up one large change into multiple commits
- staging helps in reviewing change
- staging helps when a merge has conflicts
- staging helps you keep extra local files hanging around

Besides these kinds of specific situations, feel free to skip the index.

## 5) "There are no server repositories"
A lot of the time we designate and use certain repositories like an SVN server,
but this is an analogy at best, and taking it too far can lead to confusion
later on -- especially concerning expected behavior with branches.

The most common times we think of git in a client-server model is when cloning
from a repository that is hosted on a server somewhere, like Github, Gitlab, or
otherwise. In some ways, this "cloned-from" repository does get a little bit of
special treatment by default (but it can be turned off), and as a result it
typically gets named "origin" by default. However, git is designed to be
distributed, and its behavior is centered around the assumption that you want
the local repository to interact with multiple other repositories, not just the
one that was cloned from. Git's behavior is very configurable, but the defaults
are usually conservative and try to make fewer assumptions about what you want.

So to think like git does, always start off by thinking of all branches and
repositories as being equal regardless of their locations or any other
pre-existing special relationships that may or may not apply to the present case
(branch) that you are working with. Starting from this point, it is easier to
understand branching and remote operations and how other previously-defined
relationships (like "origin," "upstream," etc.) might modify the general
behavior.  Usually these "modified behaviors" consist of git setting up
conveniences, like the case where you can just say `git push` instead of `git
push src-branch dst-branch`.
