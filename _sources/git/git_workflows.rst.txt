git Workflows -- how to organize branching

Summary:

1. Centralized
2. Feature branch
3. Gitflow
4. Forking

Most of this section comes from the `Atlassian workflow overview
<https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/>`_, including the
figures (under the `CC-au license
<https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/)>`_. I like this presentation
of git workflows, because it starts from the SVN-like model that many are
comfortable with, and adds one new concept for each successive workflow. This
way, one can partition their understanding and choose the level at which they
wish to work.

I'm only going to summarize the workflows here to serve as a reminder about
their major points. If you are unfamiliar with them, go read the overview - it
doesn't take too long.

1) Centralized (SVN-like)
=========================
The centralized workflow is using git like SVN, which means using the git
"master" branch the same as SVN "trunk" and not really branching besides that --
all changes from everybody get committed to master.

Note also that in this model, rebase is probably more useful than merge, since
rebase preserves a more linear history
which looks more SVN-like.  So use things like ``git pull --rebase``.

2) Feature branch (centralized + branching)
===========================================
This model uses branches other than master for all development work; a new
branch is started for each feature or topic e.g. "cg_diagonalization" or
"issue-#1024."  Since no development work is done in master anymore, it can be
curated to represent the official project history.  Feature branches get pushed
to the central repository, where a pull request is created when the feature is
ready to become part of the official code base or when the developer wishes to
otherwise initiate discussion about the code.

Some advantages of feature branching over the centralized workflow:

* the master branch will never contain broken code
* multiple developers can work on a single feature without disturbing the main
  code base, or other concurrent feature development
* using pull requests now makes sense (PRs make code review, automated
  integration testing, and many other positive things more convenient)

3) Gitflow (Feature branch + organization and conventions)
==========================================================
In the Gitflow workflow as introduced and covered in detail by Vincent Driessen,
feature branching is used with some added ground rules for how branches are
named, where they originate from, and where they get merged/rebased to.  The
original post, ["A successful Git branching
model,"](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is well worth
a read.

At the backbone of the project are the **maste**r and the **develop** branches.
Supporting branches are all **features**, **releases**, and **hotfixes**. The
figure and table below summarize how all of these branches work together.

| naming convention | May branch off from | Must merge back into | Purpose |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------- |
| ``master``          | (none)              | (none)               |  <ul> <li>HEAD of origin/master is a production-ready state</li> <li>This is the source of automatic nightly builds</li> <li>Every merge into master represents a new production release by definition. Each commit in master is tagged with it's corresponding release version number</li> </ul> |
| ``develop``         | ``release``           | ``release``            | <ul> <li>serves as coordination point for planned development</li> <li>features end up here when they are finished</li> </ul> |
| (anything) 	    | ``develop`` 	  | ``develop``            | <ul> <li>where all planned development actually takes place</li> </ul> |
| `release-*` 	    | ``develop`` 	  | ``develop``, ``master``  | <ul> <li>created when develop contains all desired for new release</li> <li> allows final preparation for new release (merge into master) while develop is cleared to start receiving new features for next release</li> </ul> |
| `hotfix-*` 	    | ``master`` 	          | ``develop``, ``develop`` | <ul> <li>creates an unplanned bump in release version number on master to fix a critical bug that is in production</li> </ul> |

To experiment with this workflow and practice merging, rebasing, branching,
etc., the script attached at the bottom of this page will generate a repository
with the exact history shown in the figure above.

4) Forking (any workflow + forking for collaboration)
======================================================
Forking isn't a new iteration on the previous workflows; it can be applied to
any branching workflow. It is more for defining how developers interact with the
project repository.  Here, nobody clones the main project repository, but rather
forks their own copy.  This means that everybody pushes to their own copy, and
pull requests originate from forks outside of the project repository, rather
than from branches that live on the main project repository itself.

Doing this allows at least a couple of advantages/conveniences:

- allows safe integration of new code, even from untrusted contributors (since
  they don't need access to the project repository)
- even the project maintainers don't need a working (non-bare) copy of the
  project repository
