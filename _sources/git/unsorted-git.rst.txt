# Unsorted
These are things worth remembering, but don't yet have a home in the organized
information on other pages.

git branch -avv  
@{upstream} or @{u}  
git add -p  
git status -s  
git commit -v  
git log -Sstring  
Git log with file name  
git blame  
git log -L 1,1:some-file.txt  
https://github.com/github/hub  
git pull -X theirs  
git reset --hard origin/mybranch (and friends - see e.g.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9301782/need-to-reset-git-branch-to-origin-version)  

Fetch a group of remotes
```
$ git config remotes.default 'origin bob staging' 
$ git remote update 
# fetches remotes "origin", "bob", and "staging"
```

Delete a branch here, and everywhere
```
$ git branch -d mybranch  (deletes locally)
$ git push origin :mybranch (uses "git push <remote> <localbranch>:<remotebranch>" syntax to delete remote branch)
$ git fetch --all --prune (use this on other machines to propagate the changes and get rid of "obsolete tracking branches") 
```
It’s often helpful to get a review of all the commits that are in this branch
but that aren’t in your master branch. You can exclude commits in the master
branch by adding the --not option before the branch name. This does the same
thing as the master..contrib format that we used earlier. For example, if your
contributor sends you two patches and you create a branch called contrib and
applied those patches there, you can run this:

```
$ git log contrib --not master

updated the gemspec to hopefully work better
To see what changes each commit introduces, remember that you can pass the -p
option to git log and it will append the diff introduced to each commit.

To see a full diff of what would happen if you were to merge this topic branch
with another branch, you may have to use a weird trick to get the correct
results. You may think to run this:

`$ git diff master`  

This command gives you a diff, but it may be misleading. If your master branch
has moved forward since you created the topic branch from it, then you’ll get
seemingly strange results. This happens because Git directly compares the
snapshots of the last commit of the topic branch you’re on and the snapshot of
the last commit on the master branch. For example, if you’ve added a line in a
file on the master branch, a direct comparison of the snapshots will look like
the topic branch is going to remove that line.

If master is a direct ancestor of your topic branch, this isn’t a problem; but
if the two histories have diverged, the diff will look like you’re adding all
the new stuff in your topic branch and removing everything unique to the master
branch.

What you really want to see are the changes added to the topic branch – the
work you’ll introduce if you merge this branch with master. You do that by
having Git compare the last commit on your topic branch with the first common
ancestor it has with the master branch.

Technically, you can do that by explicitly figuring out the common ancestor and
then running your diff on it:

```
$ git merge-base contrib master
36c7dba2c95e6bbb78dfa822519ecfec6e1ca649
$ git diff 36c7db
```
However, that isn’t convenient, so Git provides another shorthand for doing the
same thing: the triple-dot syntax. In the context of the diff command, you can
put three periods after another branch to do a diff between the last commit of
the branch you’re on and its common ancestor with another branch:

`$ git diff master...contrib`  
This command shows you only the work your current topic branch has introduced
since its common ancestor with master. That is a very useful syntax to
remember.

Next, try to make each commit a logically separate changeset. If you can, try
to make your changes digestible

The Git project provides a document that lays out a number of good tips for
creating commits from which to submit patches – you can read it in the Git
source code in the Documentation/SubmittingPatches file.

First, you don’t want to submit any whitespace errors. Git provides an easy way
to check for this – before you commit, run `git diff --check`, which identifies
possible whitespace errors and lists them for you.
