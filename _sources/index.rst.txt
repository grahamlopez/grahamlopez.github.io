I am an HPC Engineer in the National Center for Computational Sciences at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory where I work with users and applications to run at
scale on current and upcoming leadership-class computing facilities. In addition
to my direct engagement with facility users, I have published research in the
areas of computational materials science, application acceleration and
benchmarking on heterogeneous systems, low-level communication APIs, and
programming models. Prior to joining ORNL, I was a research scientist at Georgia
Institute of Technology where I worked on application and numerical algorithm
optimizations for accelerators. I earned his M.S. in Computer science and Ph.D.
in Physics from Wake forest University.

Yes, this site is made with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_, so it isn't
the most visually creative. I'm not a webdev, nor am I familiar with the common
technologies, so when I set out to make it look nice, it ended up preventing me
from getting the content up. But a lot of this content is documentation-like
anyway, so I'm going with it for now until I can figure something nicer out.
