   contain the root `toctree` directive.

I am a computing professional with a background in scientific and
high-performance computing. Currently, I am the product manager for the `HPC SDK
<https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-sdk>`_ and `HPC compilers
<https://developer.nvidia.com/hpc-compilers>`_ at NVIDIA.

Recently, I was an HPC Engineer in the National Center for Computational
Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory where I worked with users and
applications to run at scale on current and upcoming leadership-class computing
facilities. In addition to my direct engagement with facility users, I have
published research in the areas of computational materials science, application
acceleration and benchmarking on heterogeneous systems, low-level communication
APIs, and programming models.

Prior to joining ORNL, I was a research scientist at Georgia Institute of
Technology where I worked on application and numerical algorithm optimizations
for accelerators. I earned an M.S. in Computer science and Ph.D.  in Physics
from Wake forest University.

Site contents
-----------------

There isn't really a strong theme to this site; it is mostly about technical
things that I learn and use for my job. This is where I put stuff that I want to
have available for personal reference, but I also sometimes point others to when
they ask me questions about these things.

I'm trying to migrate my digital notebook(s) here both so that others might
benefit and to encourage me to keep the quality of my notes a little bit higher.
However, while some of these pages are fairly polished, a lot of it is very much
a work-in-progress as I continue to learn.

On the other hand, these pages are getting more and more outdated as I
continually neglect them.

   Yes, this site is made with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_, so it isn't
   the most visually creative. I'm not a webdev, nor am I familiar with the common
   technologies, so when I set out to make it look nice, it ended up preventing me
   from getting the content up. But a lot of this material is documentation-like
   anyway, so I'm going with it for now until I can figure out something nicer.

Read on and :ref:`contact` if you have comments, questions, or suggestions.
