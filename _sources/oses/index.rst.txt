Partitioning
=============

Here's how I'm partitioning for now. Note that with GPT, we can have as many
primary partitions as we want - no more need for extended/logical. Also remember
to make the combined boot/esp paritions FAT32.

additional encrypted drives
------------------------------

sometimes you want to make a new partition and have in encrypted, and you want
to also have it automounted at boot. I like the keyfile/crypttab idea from
`this SE answer <https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/392286>`_ pretty well; it is
general and not very complicated.

Miscellaneous
==============

Sometimes when trying to update bios images you might get a ``.iso`` image that,
when written to a flash drive with e.g. ``dd if=update.iso of=/dev/sda status=progress && sync``,
doesn't boot. This is because you actually have to extract the image first with
e.g. ``geteltorito -o x230.img g2uj33us.iso`` and then burn the ``.img`` file.
