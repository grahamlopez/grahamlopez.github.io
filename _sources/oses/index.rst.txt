Partitioning
=============

Here's how I'm partitioning for now. Note that with GPT, we can have as many
primary partitions as we want - no more need for extended/logical. Also remember
to make the combined boot/esp paritions FAT32.

Miscellaneous
==============

Sometimes when trying to update bios images you might get a ``.iso`` image that,
when written to a flash drive with e.g. ``dd if=update.iso of=/dev/sda status=progress && sync``,
doesn't boot. This is because you actually have to extract the image first with
e.g. ``geteltorito -o x230.img g2uj33us.iso`` and then burn the ``.img`` file.
