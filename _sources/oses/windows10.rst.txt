Sometimes I have to use Windows 10; here are some things that I typically do.


Ergonomics
============

capslock to control

- Create a file called "caps.reg"::

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]

    "Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,1d,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00

- Execute
- Reboot

Terminals
==========

- Alacritty config goes in ``Users/[user]/AppData/Roaming/alacritty/alacritty.yml`` (download example yaml from the releases page in github)
- One can always try setting the legacy mintty backend for a different feel -
- Cmder setup: https://gingter.org/2016/11/16/running-windows-10-ubuntu-bash-in-cmder/
- Terminus is too slow to be usable, but it looks nice.

I ended up going with Alacritty. It isn't bulletproof, but it is good
enough(TM).

WSL 1/2
========

WSL1 install
-------------

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10


The procedure I used:

- Control Panel > Programs > Turn Windows Features On Or Off. Enable the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” option in the list, and then click the “OK” button.
- Click “Restart now” when you’re prompted to restart your computer. The feature
  won’t work until you reboot.
- Install Ubuntu 18.04 from the Microsoft store (online/in a browser)
- No need to sign in to anything, even if prompted

Configuration
--------------

Turn off terminal beep: uncomment ``set bell-style none`` in ``/etc/inputrc``
- Doesn't work for zsh, so put ``unsetopt BEEP`` in ``~/.zshrc``
- Better: just change "Critical Stop" in Sound Scheme (control panel) to

    - "Windows Navigation Start.wav"
    - "Windows Menu Command.wav"
    - but setting to (None) doesn't work hashtagangryface
