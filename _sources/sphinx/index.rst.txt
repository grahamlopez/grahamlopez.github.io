working with sphinx
####################

These are mostly out of date and useful notes to myself about how to make
various changes to the way sphinx renders things. I typically just have to
google around until I find cut-and-paste solutions because I've never bothered
to learn how CSS and everything else actually hangs together.

general
========

configuration: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#

* To change how the sidebar is rendered, these settings are in ``conf.py``::

    html_sidebars = {
       '**': ['globaltoc.html', 'searchbox.html'],
    }

  see for example `the sphinx docs
  <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_sidebars>`_

* For opening external links in new tabs
  http://jack.rosenth.al/hacking-docutils.html#sphinx-hacks::

    from sphinx.writers.html import HTMLTranslator
    class PatchedHTMLTranslator(HTMLTranslator):
        def visit_reference(self, node):
            if node.get('newtab') or not (node.get('target') or node.get('internal') or 'refuri' not in node):
                node['target'] = '_blank'
            super().visit_reference(node)

    def setup(app):
        app.set_translator('html', PatchedHTMLTranslator)

* If using this with github pages, we'll need a ``.nojekyll`` file in the root
  of the pages repo.

classic theme
=============

(possibly only relevant to the classic theme)

The "relbar" is the bar at the top and/or bottom that has the link to home as
well as possibly "next | prev". To change the text/link of the home, add the
following to ``_templates/layout``::

    {% extends "!layout.html" %}
    {% block rootrellink %}
        <li><a href="localhost:8080">grahamlopez.org</a> &raquo;</li>
    {% endblock %}

or you can even disable it completely with::

    {% extends "!layout.html" %}
    {% block relbar1 %}{% endblock %}
    {% block relbar2 %}{% endblock %}

alabaster theme
===============

docs at https://alabaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customization.html

(possibly only relevant to the classic theme)

override css from the ``alabaster.css_t`` template in ``_static/custom.css``.
