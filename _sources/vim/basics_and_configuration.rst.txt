Basics and configuration
*************************

Some of this is quite basic, but I regularly encounter people who have been
using vim for 10+ years that don't know some of these tricks. This is one of the
blessings/curses of vim, that there is almost always something new to learn even
at the basic levels.

- :help, :helptags, :helpgrep
    - navigating help pages via tags
- :map, :imap, etc.
- set paste
- insert mode shortcuts
    - c-w,u, c-t/d, c-g, al. (:help ins-special-keys)
- config walkthrough
- ctrl-k (man pages, vim help when editing .vimrc)
- wildmenu, wildmode
- display
    - set bg=dark
        - colorschemes, :hi customization, etc.
    - set nu and variants
    - statusline
    - folding
