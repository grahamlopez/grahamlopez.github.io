Vim
####

Similarly to the :ref:`git-pages`, this is not attempting to be a comprehensive
tutorial on vim, since there are so many of those resources available already
that would be better than anything I am willing to produce.

Rather, these are some notes about intermediate to advanced ways that I
generally use vim, as well as a place to collect things to make vim more
IDE-like, and maybe some thoughts about my past and ongoing adventures with vim
vs. other editors and IDEs. These pages are assuming at least a solid beginner
level familiarity with vim.
